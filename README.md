# Purpose:
##### The purpose of our app is documented here (URL Shortener App V2)

  #### *Automating the Jenkins build and AWS Beanstalk deployment w/ Webhooks:*
  ##### Automating the build and deployment phases of a CICD pipeline will eliminate manual work and prevent human errors. We can configure a _"polling"_ setting that will check our repository at time interval that we specify. Using Webhooks, we can configure a _"trigger"_ that will send a signal to Jenkins after every new _"push"_ to our code GitHub code repository. Both methods will automatically build, test and redeploy our app, reducing our deployment time and labor cost.

# Steps:
## 1. [Create a new GitHub repo and download the application files from the source repo](https://github.com/djtoler/URL-Shortener-Deployment2/blob/main/Deployment2DownloadUploadFiles.md)
## 2. [Upload files to the new GitHub you created](https://github.com/djtoler/URL-Shortener-Deployment2/blob/main/UploadFilesToGitHub.md)
## 3. [Set Up Jenkins with Python on an EC2 instance & run the Jenkins Build](https://github.com/djtoler/URL-Shortener-Deployment2/blob/main/Deployment2JenkinsMarkdown.md)
## 4. [Extract the zip file that Jenkins will create](https://github.com/djtoler/URL-Shortener-Deployment2/blob/main/ExtractZipFromJenkins.md)
## 5. [Deploy the application on AWS Beanstalk](https://scribehow.com/shared/How_to_Create_and_Deploy_a_Python_URL_Shortener_on_AWS_Elastic_Beanstalk__MS9pB8lfRaGFiKAq2FU-cw)
